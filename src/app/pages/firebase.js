      I recommend Firebase Functions because it provides easy access to the Firebase ecosystem.

      Firebase is a great platform for building apps. It's fairly easy set up authentication. It also provides simple integration with Firestore, a data store that scales with your app usage. Perfect for a weekend project that could become a side business.

      That said, your Firebase Functions are actually Google Cloud Functions. That's important to remember if you run into issues and start looking for answers.
